# HW3 JavaScript: Pass_Generator

## My Task
This weeks homework required me to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they've sleceted. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I write. It will have a clean and polished, reponsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
1. When you click the button to generate a password
you are then presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

2. When prompted for password criteria
you will then select which criteria to include in the password

3. When prompted for the length of the password
you will then choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

4. When promted for character types to include in the password
you will then choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

5. When you answer each prompt
your input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

6. When all prompts are answered
then a password will be generated that matches the selected criteria

7. When the password is generated
the password will be displayed in an alert or written on the page.
```
